The Retirement Portfolio Management System is differentiated by centering on bucket management. It is designed to give individual investors control over a hybrid bucket and LDI strategy using a configurable rules-engine that offers a level of customisation and oversight absent in competitors like BucketsFP or RightCapital. It integrates UK-specific tax features, such as SIPP drawdown tracking and Capital Gains Tax (CGT) calculations, addressing gaps in US-centric tools like ProjectionLab or Boldin that focus on Roth/ACA rules. Unlike spreadsheet-heavy solutions (e.g., Pralana, TCRP) or ecosystem-locked platforms (e.g., Empower, Schwab) it is designed for ease and flexibility.
